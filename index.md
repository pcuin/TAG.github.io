### Goal
This project focuses on traffic and its probability to become independent of human assistance. What does that mean? A data modeling algorith built by arbitrary means, with a bit of statistics and assumptions. 
Traffic is far more sophisticated than presented here. Thus, we present a simplified version that mirriors a real-world effect, except we know certain things that would be very hard to estimate.

# Scenario - Magnitude of Traffic (MoT)
Magnitude of Traffic is described as the extent to which traffic is minimized to near 0 (optimal driver) or magnified to near 1 (reckless driver), approximation-based of course. Imagine a bivariate scenario (only two factors utilized), which will be picked by you. Why? Making a model will require interpretation, which can be assigned by the following guidelines:\
\
`A ranging variable that directly scales the MoT`\
`A correlated variable that fixes a factor at the ideal ratio (near 0) and observes deviations (magnify MoT)`\

_factors can be as simple or abstract as you want, it's arbitrary for the purposes of this lab._ 
\
You must be able to visualize your data with python fundamentals, rather than standard models due to hypothetical limitations and piloting priority in the current phase of data gathering. In addition, this software must be passed off and customizable to the extent of similar contexts, where abstract flow/factors can be collected from unpredicatble systems, *like economic applications: markets and stocks*. \
\
Itâ€™s up to you to observe and generate some factors, random samples, useful statistics, & creative modelling that will improve the flow of traffic (in principle).
